  Predict individual health insurance charges using demographics and lifestyle data — deployed as a real-time web app for instant cost estimation.
</p>

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to predict **health insurance charges** based on user input such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and more.  
It enables **insurance providers** and **consumers** to estimate potential premiums using **machine learning models** trained on real-world data.

> ✅ Built using the **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**, achieving:  
> - 🔍 **R² Score > 0.988**  
> - ⚙️ Deployed with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly experience

## 📊 Key Highlights

- 🧮 Predicts medical insurance charges using:
  - Age, Sex, BMI
  - Number of children
  - Smoking status
  - Region of residence
- ⚙️ Model trained using **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**
- 🛠️ Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
- 💡 Deployed via **Streamlit web app** for instant predictions

### ✅ Results

- 🧠 Developed a machine learning model using **50,000+ records**, achieving an **R² score of 0.988** for health insurance premium prediction.
- 📉 Reduced extreme prediction errors for users under age 25 from **73% to 2%** using **age-based segmentation** and retraining with additional features.
- 🔧 Executed **10+ preprocessing steps** including:
  - Outlier removal
  - Feature engineering
  - Encoding techniques
  - **VIF-based feature reduction** to eliminate multicollinearity
- ⚡ Deployed final model as a **real-time Streamlit app**, enabling predictions in **under 1 second** with **age-specific model selection** logic.
